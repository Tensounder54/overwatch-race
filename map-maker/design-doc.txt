X - next index


Y - Prev state
Z - State




State 0 - initialization


J - [(0,0,0)]
K - [3]
L <= []

goto state 1


State 1 - create hud texts


Create checkpoint place text
Create x edit text
Create y edit text
Create z edit text
Create size edit text
Create index edit text


Create world icon for current index


Create “NEW” text


Goto state 2


state 2 - create node display 0 through 9
Do the thing, however many times and rules
Final - goto state 10


State 10 - Set up edit effect


create effect:
pos - M
size - N
vis - all
update - pos and size


P = last created effect
goto state 20 - edit effect set position


state 20 and primary fire - move effect

goto state 91


state is >=30 and state <= 33 and interact - change to place mode
goto state 21


state is >= 20 and sate <= 39 and ultimate - go to index change mode

Goto state 51


State 51 and work remains - build world text
Cond: size of(A) > 0


State 51 and work finished - finish building word text
Goto state 40


State 55 and text remains - clean up world text display
Clean text


State 55 and no text remains- finish world text clean
Goto state Y

state 91 - release all the buttons state
Cond: all buttons i'm checking == false
state = Y
