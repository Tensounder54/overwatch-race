## FAQ

#### How do I start? I'm stuck in the spawn room!

Press your ultimate button (defaults to Q). This will spawn you into the race.

#### I messed up, how to I restart?

You can press ultimate (default Q) again during a run to restart.

#### What is this optimize circle?

You can change options here. Optimize was the closest word in the allowed strings. Select options with primary/secondary fire (left and right click) and toggle options with interact (default F).

The options are:
 - Option 1: skip countdown
 - Option 2: mute sound effects
 
For more detailed instructions, [please read the wiki](https://github.com/lunetoiles/overwatch-race/wiki/Player-options-(optimize)) (coming soon).

#### I just started a map and I'm frozen and can't move, what is happening?

This is the game capturing control points and moving the payload to open all the doors on the map and get the payload out of the way. Just wait a few moments and it will finish and the game will start.

#### How do I run my own server?

Just load one of the codes below, set yourself to team 2 slot 1 to make yourself the moderator, and start the match. For detailed instructions, [please read the wiki](https://github.com/lunetoiles/overwatch-race/wiki/How-to-host-a-server) (coming soon).

#### How do I make my own map?

You can create your own map by using the "Map maker" and "Gather room editor" codes below, and entering the data into the first 4 rules of the workshop mode. Detailed instructions are [on the wiki](https://github.com/lunetoiles/overwatch-race/wiki/How-to-make-a-new-map) (coming soon).
